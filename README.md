# 1802-8Queens

This repository describes the design and code of a classic: the 8 Queens problem. This problem is normally solved with backtracking (a recursive, depth-first tree search). 

The code is designed for the RCA 1802 CPU with UT4 as OS-ish. The code runs on the RCA2020 (see other repository) implementation of an 1802 SBC, but is easily portable to any 1802 system.

The solution is not based on backtracking but on loops. Background is the solution originally is designed for my TI-59 (see other repository) and (by hand) cross compiled to the 1802.
